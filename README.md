# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


I have used Vite + React for this project, also tailwind css for styling.
In order to see my project , open the vs code then extract my github code in it,
after extracting the files from my github repo open the terminal and do npm i to install the required packages,
and to run the application you have to do 'run dev start' in the terminal to open locally,
if you want to check it live then visit the following link: https://mhers-music-playlist.vercel.app
